Hi, I'm Brandon. I like kind people and I write a bit of code. Mostly, I think AI robs me of the things I'd find along the way if I did my own exploring. It's like starting an adventure game (life) and immediately opening a potentially out of date player walkthrough guide. But maybe I'm strange in that I prefer the journey to the destination.
